# CipherClash

CipherClash is a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) powered Rockâ€“Paperâ€“Scissors dApp built on top of the Zama fhEVM protocol.  
It lets players stake funds, submit encrypted moves, and obtain the result on-chain without revealing their choices.

## Key Features

- **Private moves** â€“ every hand (rock, paper, scissors) is encrypted on the client with `@fhevm/react` and verified on-chain with `@fhevm/solidity`.
- **Instant settlement** â€“ once both moves are in, anyone can trigger `finalizeMatch` to pay the winner (or refund on ties).
- **Visual battle flow** â€“ the frontend shows a four-step progress bar and a chain event timeline so spectators can follow each match.
- **Leaderboard & rematch** â€“ victories earn points, and players can reopen a match for a rematch window to continue the rivalry.

## Project Structure

```
contracts/   Hardhat project with CipherClashRegistry and CipherClash contracts
frontend/    React + Vite app (RainbowKit, wagmi, @fhevm/react integration)
docs/        Detailed guides: architecture, deployment, testing
scripts/     Helper scripts (environment bootstrap, demo runbook)
```

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install --filter contracts
   pnpm install --filter frontend
   ```
2. **Compile & test the contracts**
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   pnpm hardhat compile
   pnpm hardhat test
   ```
3. **Configure & run the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   cp .env.example .env   # fill in registry + fhEVM addresses after deployment
   pnpm run dev
   ```
