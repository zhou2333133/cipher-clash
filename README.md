# CipherClash â€“ Play Rock, Paper, Scissors Without Revealing Your Hand

CipherClash is a cheeky little duel where cryptography does the bluffing for you.  
Two players stake a tiny amount of ETH, secretly choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and let fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) decide the winnerâ€”no peeking, no leaks, just pure encrypted rivalry.

---

## Why itâ€™s fun (and useful)

- **Moves stay secret**  
  Hands are encrypted in the browser with `@fhevm/react`, shipped on-chain, and compared in Solidity without ever exposing the raw values.

- **Winner gets paid immediately**  
  Once both moves land, anybody can call `finalizeMatch` to distribute the stakes. Ties trigger an automatic refundâ€”no middleman needed.

- **Follow the drama**  
  The frontend renders a four-step progress bar and an on-chain timeline so spectators can watch the battle unfold in real time.

- **Keep score & rematch**  
  Victories add points to the leaderboard, and both players can reopen a finished room for another encrypted round.
